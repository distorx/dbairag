# Column Intelligence Improvements for RAG SQL Service

## Overview
Enhanced the RAG service to better understand column name references and their contextual meanings, especially for location-based queries where a city can be referenced through multiple columns (postal address vs physical address).

## Key Improvements

### 1. Column Intelligence Service Integration
- Added `ColumnIntelligenceService` that analyzes column semantics
- Identifies location columns, temporal columns, relationship columns, status columns, and identifiers
- Understands the difference between postal and physical address columns

### 2. Semantic Analysis
The service now performs semantic analysis on database schemas to understand:
- **Location Columns**: Identifies city, state, region columns and their purposes
- **Column Context**: Differentiates between `CityIdPhysical` (where someone lives) and `CityIdPostal` (mailing address)
- **Relationship Detection**: Automatically detects foreign key relationships to Cities table

### 3. Enhanced Query Generation

#### Location-Aware Queries
The system now correctly handles queries like:
- `"count students from Bayamon"` → Uses CityIdPhysical by default
- `"count students from postal city Bayamon"` → Uses CityIdPostal
- `"count students from physical city Ponce"` → Uses CityIdPhysical
- `"show students where city is San Juan"` → Returns student details with city name

#### Generated SQL Examples

For "count students from Bayamon":
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.Id) AS total
FROM Students s WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN Cities c WITH (NOLOCK) ON s.CityIdPhysical = c.Id
WHERE c.Name LIKE '%Bayamon%'
```

For "count students from postal city Bayamon":
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.Id) AS total
FROM Students s WITH (NOLOCK)
INNER JOIN Cities c WITH (NOLOCK) ON s.CityIdPostal = c.Id
WHERE c.Name LIKE '%Bayamon%'
```

### 4. LLM Prompt Enhancement
Updated the LLM prompt to include:
- Explicit instructions about location column semantics
- Guidelines for using appropriate city columns based on query context
- Understanding that Cities are normalized and require JOINs

### 5. Schema Context Enhancement
The schema context now includes:
- Semantic information about columns
- Clear indication of which columns are for postal vs physical addresses
- Relationship mappings for location-based queries

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
1. **optimized_rag_service.py**
   - Integrated column intelligence service
   - Enhanced pattern matching with semantic analysis
   - Improved schema context building
   - Updated LLM prompts with column understanding

2. **column_intelligence_service.py**
   - Analyzes column semantics
   - Generates location-aware queries
   - Extracts location keywords from natural language

### Key Methods

#### `analyze_column_semantics()`
Analyzes database schema to categorize columns by their semantic meaning:
- Location columns (city, state, region, address)
- Temporal columns (creation, update, birth dates)
- Relationship columns (foreign keys)
- Status columns
- Identifier columns

#### `generate_location_aware_query()`
Generates SQL queries that understand location context:
- Detects city references in natural language
- Chooses appropriate column (postal vs physical)
- Creates proper JOINs with Cities table

## Benefits

1. **Improved Accuracy**: Queries now use the correct city column based on context
2. **Better Understanding**: System understands that "city" can mean different things
3. **Normalized Data Support**: Properly handles normalized city data with JOINs
4. **Context Awareness**: Differentiates between postal and physical addresses
5. **Puerto Rico Specific**: Includes common PR city names for better recognition

## Usage Examples

### Simple City Query
Input: `"count students from Bayamon"`
- System identifies "Bayamon" as a city
- Uses CityIdPhysical (default for physical location)
- JOINs with Cities table to match city name

### Postal Address Query
Input: `"count students from postal city Bayamon"`
- System recognizes "postal" modifier
- Uses CityIdPostal for mailing address
- JOINs with Cities table appropriately

### Multiple City Support
The system can handle queries checking both postal and physical locations:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT s.Id) AS total 
FROM Students s WITH (NOLOCK) 
LEFT JOIN Cities c1 WITH (NOLOCK) ON s.CityIdPhysical = c1.Id 
LEFT JOIN Cities c2 WITH (NOLOCK) ON s.CityIdPostal = c2.Id 
WHERE c1.Name LIKE '%Bayamon%' OR c2.Name LIKE '%Bayamon%'
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Extended Location Support**: Add support for regions, municipios, and neighborhoods
2. **Temporal Intelligence**: Better understanding of date-based queries
3. **Multi-Language Support**: Handle Spanish location terms (ciudad, municipio)
4. **Caching**: Cache semantic analysis for frequently used schemas
5. **Learning**: Track successful queries to improve pattern matching
